# CODE BUDDY - YOUR CODE CHAT FRIEND
## Made By Aryan Tiwari as a Portfolio Project

A chat AI app which uses OpenAI API key to fetch a artificial intelligent based chat environment build in developement environment of VITE with server dependencies of Node js modules like CORS, DOTENV for security of server and API key, EXPRESS, and NODEMON to concate node and source code, so that changes in source code can be implemented in node

OpenAI API - The OpenAI API is a set of tools and services that allows developers to access the capabilities of OpenAI's machine learning models through a simple API. The API provides access to a variety of models, including GPT-3, which can be used for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, and summarization. The API is designed to be easy to use, with simple endpoints for submitting requests and receiving results. Additionally, the API provides access to a variety of other tools and resources, such as pre-trained models, code samples, and documentation. The API is accessible to anyone with a valid API key, which can be obtained by signing up for an OpenAI account.

VITE - Vite is an open-source, lightweight, and high-performance development environment built for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Vite blockchain. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for developers to build, test, and deploy their dApps. The Vite blockchain is a public, decentralized, and open-source blockchain that aims to provide fast, low-cost, and secure transactions.

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) - CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers that blocks web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to sensitive data on other websites.

CORS allows web servers to specify which websites are authorized to make cross-origin requests to their resources. This is done by setting certain HTTP headers in the server's response to a request, such as the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, which lists the domains that are allowed to make cross-origin requests to the server's resources.When a browser receives a response from a server that includes the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, it will check if the origin of the request (the domain of the web page making the request) is listed in that header. If it is, the browser will allow the request to be made, otherwise it will block the request.

DOTENV - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file. It allows developers to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other configuration options in a separate file, rather than hard-coding them in their application. This is useful because it allows different configurations to be used for different environments, such as development, testing, and production. 
When the application starts, the dotenv library is used to load the variables from the .env file into the environment. Then, the application can access these variables by using the `process.env` object. For example, if the .env file contains a variable named API_KEY, the application can access this variable by calling `process.env.API_KEY`.

NODEMON - Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when changes are made to its source code. This can save developers time by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the application every time a change is made. Nodemon works by monitoring the application's source code for changes and automatically restarting the application when a change is detected.

EXPRESS - Express.js is a popular, open-source, and minimal web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, such as routing, middleware, and template engines.

Express.js uses a routing system that allows developers to define how their application should respond to different URLs and HTTP methods. It also provides middleware functionality, which is a way to add functionality to the request/response cycle. Middleware can be used to add functionality such as logging, authentication, and error handling to an application.
